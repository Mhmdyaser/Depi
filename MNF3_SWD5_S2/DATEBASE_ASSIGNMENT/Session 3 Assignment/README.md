# Session 3 Assignment

This assignment contains two SQL tasks designed to practice key database concepts such as data definition, data manipulation, and querying.

## üìÅ Files

### 1. Task 1.sql
This script likely includes:
- Creating tables (DDL statements)
- Defining relationships between tables
- Applying constraints such as PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY

### 2. Task 2.sql
This script likely includes:
- Data insertion (DML statements)
- Performing various SELECT queries to retrieve specific data
- Filtering, sorting, and joining data from multiple tables

## ‚úÖ How to Use
1. Open each `.sql` file in your SQL database tool (e.g., MySQL Workbench, SQL Server Management Studio, etc.)
2. Execute `Task 1.sql` first to create the necessary schema.
3. Then run `Task 2.sql` to manipulate and query the data.
