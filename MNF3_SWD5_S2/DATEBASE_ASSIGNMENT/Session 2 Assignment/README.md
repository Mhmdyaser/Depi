# Database Session 2

This project contains essential resources for understanding and working with a sample database schema. It includes SQL scripts and diagrams for both the ERD and the physical schema.

## Contents

- `DDL.sql` – Contains SQL commands to create the database structure (tables, constraints, etc.).
- `DML.sql` – Includes sample data insertion commands for populating the database.
- `ERD.png` – A visual Entity-Relationship Diagram showing entities and their relationships.
- `Schema.png` – A diagram illustrating the database schema as implemented.

## How to Use

1. **Set up your database**:
   - Run the SQL statements in `DDL.sql` to create the database schema.
   - Run the SQL statements in `DML.sql` to populate the tables with sample data.

2. **Review the design**:
   - Use `ERD.png` to understand the logical relationships between entities.
   - Use `Schema.png` to visualize the actual database structure and table layout.

## Requirements

- A relational database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server)
- SQL client or IDE (e.g., DBeaver, MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin)
